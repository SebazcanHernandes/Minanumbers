# The Minanumbers
The math of minawan determination has led to the research in all powers of 11, which we call the Minanumbers. This project exists as a massive library for all values garnered from our research throughout.

## Context

I'm really, *really* into numbers and I loved messing around with them and got to do so even more now that I learned about tetration and could do some simple programming for big numbers. This project is all about getting to higher and higher numbers.

The _**minanumbers**_, as I like to call it (and first coined by captainofindustry1060, known as Clippywan), is a project of mine that seeks to find these massive **WANWAN** values! In this case, it would be WANWAN (which is **11** here) tetrated to n, or `WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ ... ^ WANWAN (n times)`, or simply written as **ⁿWANWAN**.

> This section is now outdated. **_Minanumbers_** refer to all powers of WANWAN.

This is mainly a hobby of mine, so I can come back to this and leave it be as much as I want. Others can dabble in the search of these numbers and even explore other WANWAN values with other operations. Come along and have fun!

The numbering system is a bit confusing, I know.

All minanumbers could be found in [**All Powers**](https://github.com/SebazcanHernandes/Minanumbers/tree/main/All%20Powers). A Subset of minanumbers could be found in [**All Hyperpowers**](https://github.com/SebazcanHernandes/Minanumbers/tree/main/All%20Hyperpowers), which are the results of tetrating WANWAN, named the nth-degree minanumbers.
- Folders in **All Powers** are sets of 100 values. Each number in each filename corresponds to the n in `WANWAN ^ n`. Only `WANWAN ^ 0` is isolated.
- Numbering in the main **All Hyperpowers** folder corresponds to the n in `WANWAN ^^ n` (ⁿWANWAN, WANWAN tetrated to n).
- A folder in **All Hyperpowers** named **Pre-degrees** has subfolders of its own.
  - Subfolders are numbered `a-(a+1)`, corresponding to the hyperexponents. They carry the values from ᵃWANWAN to ᵃ⁺¹WANWAN, showing the progress in calculations.
  - Files in these subfolders have folders from 01 to 11, corresponding to the n of `WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ ... ^ WANWAN (a times) ^ n`.
  - When a value reaches more than 1048576 digits (or a megabyte of data [MB]), they are split as `n_x.txt` files, separating all digits to be visible to all.

## Trivia

- Minanumbers are pure values as WANWAN is a prime value, meaning no other numbers besides fellow minanumbers could divide it without remainders.
- The higher the exponent, an additional digit is added. You can do the math for the rate of 2 digits to happen with what's available so far.

| n | WANWAN ^ n | Digits of WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ n |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 11 | 12 |
| 2 | 121 | 127 |
| 3 | 1331 | 1387 |
| 4 | 14641 | 15248 |
| 5 | 161051 | 167718 |
| 6 | 1771561 | 1844891 |
