# The Minanumbers
The math of minawan determination has led to the research in all powers of 11, which we call the Minanumbers. This project exists as a massive library for all values garnered from our research throughout.

## Context

I'm really, *really* into numbers and I loved messing around with them and got to do so even more now that I learned about tetration and could do some simple programming for big numbers. This project is all about getting to higher and higher numbers.

The Minanumbers, as I like to call it (and first coined by captainofindustry1060, known as Clippywan), is a project of mine that seeks to find these massive WANWAN values! In this case, it would be WANWAN (which is 11 here) tetrated to n, or WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ ... ^ WANWAN (n times), or simply written as ‚ÅøWANWAN.

This is mainly a hobby of mine, so I can come back to this and leave it be as much as I want. Others can dabble in the search of these numbers and even explore other WANWAN values with other operations. Come along and have fun!
