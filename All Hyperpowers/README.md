# nth-degree Minanumbers

This directory serves as the library of all hyperpowers of WANWAN, dubbed as the Completel List of nth-degree Minanumbers.

- Numbering in the main **All Hyperpowers** folder corresponds to the n in `WANWAN ^^ n` (ⁿWANWAN, WANWAN tetrated to n).
- A folder in **All Hyperpowers** named **Pre-degrees** has subfolders of its own.
  - Subfolders are numbered `a-(a+1)`, corresponding to the hyperexponents. They carry the values from ᵃWANWAN to ᵃ⁺¹WANWAN, showing the progress in calculations.
  - Files in these subfolders have files from 01 to 11, corresponding to the n of `WANWAN ^ WANWAN ^ ... ^ WANWAN (a times) ^ n`.
  - (Hopefully that ain't confusing.)

## Trivia

- The term nth-degree minanumbers was first created by Subwan (me) when minanumbers were still not broaden to powers of WANWAN.
- The shorthand notation for these numbers is **mina_n_**, where n is the hyperexponent.
